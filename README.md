# Learning_OOPS and Basic Programs
The 'Learning OOPS' repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing Object-Oriented Programming concepts. 

Basic Programs:

1. **Fibonacci Series**: Write a program to generate the Fibonacci series up to n terms.
2. **Palindrome**: Write a program to check whether a string or number is a palindrome or not.
3. **Prime Numbers**: Write a program to find all prime numbers within a given range.
4. **Factorial**: Write a program to find the factorial of a number.
5. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implement basic sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, etc.
6. **String Reversal**: Write a program to reverse a string.
7. **Count Occurrences**: Write a program to count the occurrence of a specific character in a string.
8. **Anagram**: Write a program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other.
9. **Armstrong Number**: Write a program to check if a number is an Armstrong number.
10. **Pattern Printing**: Write a program to print various patterns like pyramid, diamond, etc.

Remember, the key to solving these problems is understanding the problem statement clearly and knowing the basic concepts of Python programming
